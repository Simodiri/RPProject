# 2D Lidar Matcher
I implented a 2D scan matcher, that takes in input 2D laser scans and, using ICP to find the transformation matrix between them.
In order to start it, follow this steps:
- First start the webctl from the repository of robot programming
- Start roscore, stage and map_server that will be used to take the laser scans
-
